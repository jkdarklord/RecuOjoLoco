â€”Aurora Unit 217
A Chozebo (as named in the internal data for Metroid Prime 3: Corruption) is a retractable cover used in the SkyTown Federation Landing Site and Landing Site A. The name is a portmanteau between "Chozo" and "gazebo", owing to its Chozo origin and gazebo-like shape. It appears as a retractable set of four triangular plates that can be clamped down, preventing their retraction. Aurora Unit 217 removes the clamps during Samus' first visit to both Landing Sites, which raises a Bomb Slot under the Chozebo. When Samus uses it, the plates retract, and the Bomb Slot sinks into the floor. Samus can then land her Gunship there and, in the SkyTown Federation Landing Site, upgrade it with the Ship Grapple Beam.
