I would make this a RickRoll, but...


I am as old as my skin and a little bit older than my teeth. Hahah. A lame joke. Something I excel at. Anyway;
I am a Rollback on this site. Though I've never used it. Unless you have a death wish...
I am also a patroller. I see everything you do...
I don't edit much, I mostly patrol and criticize others for editing poorly. XD
I love destroying things, 0% running Metroid Fusion, (Or at least attempting it) and concepting ideas I'd like to send to Nintendo.
I hold the Montgomery County/D.C. area record for Metroid Fusion non-TAS 100% speed run, with a time of 1:49 and a percentage... of... 101%. No crap. 100%. DUH.

Favorite Metroid Game: Fusion, or Echoes. Or Corruption. Whatever.
Favorite Boss: Nightmare in Fusion, or Dark Samus on the Sanctuary lift, or Quadraxis. I like robots and cyborgs.
Favorite beam: Nova, MP3
Favorite Charge Combo: Darkburst, MP2
Favorite area: Sanctuary, MP2. I like mechanical areas.
Favorite Bounty Hunter: Ghor or Sylux.
Favorite Planet: Aether... or Bryyo... does Ceres count? No? Ok, fine.
I have all the Metroid games except Metroid 2, as my battery backup died.
I am blind in my left eye.
I like giving useless knowledge to others who are in need of it... WTF?
I edit Wikitroid (told you my knowledge is useless).
I am in existence.
My heart beats.
I breathe.
My pet metroid, Dood Da Gi.
I also have a pet larval Metroid. SCREW YOU, MP2 PIRATE LOGS! METROIDS CAN BE PETS! Wait, why do I have a Metroid if I'm an X?
SA-X is having a Birthday party tonight, and I don't want to miss it.
My MPH friend code is:
4169
8705
3315
Yeah... I had 2 Mph carts, lost both, and got a new one, so my stats kinda suck right now.
TELL ME YOUR CODE IF YOU TAKE MINE!!!!

How to Put Ridley in Smash.

Can't decide which is stranger:
o.0
I like the part where she says Nimu.
O.K. I'm gonna go fry that oversized lobster Trace with my Shock Coil now. For real this time.

Thy sandbox of Sylux X, thy owner of souls and manipulator of thee.
OK, I'M SERIOUSLY DONE NOW. GOD! (Correction: Sylux X is a Bruce Leeist... so more realistically, BRUCE LEE!!)
