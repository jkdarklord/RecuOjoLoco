â€”A-Voq, referring to the Gravity Boost.
The Gravity Boost upgrade on Samus.
The Gravity Boost is a Luminoth technology once used by A-Kul, the champion of Aether. Developed during the war, it negates the effect of liquid hindrance on its users. At some point the Ing stole this device and sealed it within the deepest part of Torvus' flooded temple. The Ing most likely took it after they killed A-Kul in the Sky Temple Grounds.
Samus Aran reclaimed the Gravity Boost power-up in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. It helped Samus move through the water with ease and let her do a triple Space Jump underwater (it actually makes her float, but it does the same job.) It was located in Torvus Bog, at the Hydrochamber Storage Room. When Samus collected it, she had to fight the Alpha Blogg, which was the guardian of the item (presumably a trap left by the Ing to those who would steal from them).
Gravity Boost - Dark Torvus Temple.
The Gravity Boost has a similar effect to the Gravity Suit in other games in the series as liquids no longer hinder movement and visibility underwater is improved, but the Gravity Boost grants an additional third jump that allows Samus to further access specific areas underwater with it when possible. The Gravity Boost also functions in the waters of Dark Aether, however Samus will not sink into them without the Light Suit.
Item form.
While just about to fight the Chykka at the Dark Torvus Temple, if Samus steps into the Dark Water around the larva's shell while firing the Seeker Launcher, for the rest of the battle Samus will have water physics, allowing use of the Gravity Boost, until Dark Water collides with her again.
"An attachment that clips snugly onto the back of Samus's Dark Suit, the Gravity Boost allows her to float in deep water."
Samus uses the Gravity Boost out of water.
