The Celestial Archives is the first area explored in the Alimbic Cluster. Soon after landing here, Samus encounters her first rival bounty hunter, Kanden, and battles him for an Alimbic Artifact. After defeating Kanden, Samus collects two more artifacts, battles a Cretaphid and obtains the first Octolith.
Later, after retrieving the Battlehammer from the Vesper Defense Outpost, Samus returns for a second Octolith, this time facing the Slench. The Volt Driver and Shock Coil are found here, suggesting that Sylux could have visited the Celestial Archives. This station has no Morph Ball mazes, only a few tunnels in the data-shrines
According to a scan, the Celestial Archives was the source of the message that led the hunters to the Alimbic Cluster, although it is unknown why, since Gorea sent the message from captivity. It is possible that Gorea used the station to amplify the message. According to the Logbook an "unknown mass", presumably Gorea, hit the station. This is most likely because before crashing on Alinos, Gorea could have hit the Archives which are in orbit around Alinos. Due to the crash, the Celestial Archives is severely damaged near the docking bays. The New Arrival Registration is the best example of this; its floor and walls have been mostly reduced to fragments, leaving anyone who enters exposed to the cold void of space.
