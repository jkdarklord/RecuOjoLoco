http---metroid.wikia.com-wiki-Magma_Pool.txt
The Magma Pool is a fairly large room in the Chozo Ruins region of Tallon IV. It has dangerous extreme heat because of the magma in it, and is Samus' first taste of it if she hasn't already been to the Magmoor Caverns. It can only be accessed after defeating Flaahgra and obtaining the Varia Suit. Even then the magma can only be crossed with the Grapple Beam in the Phazon Mines. Both the entrance and the other side of the room have metal crates, while the end of the room contains a large wall, composed of weakened Bendezium. Samus can use her X-Ray Visor to see behind the wall. If Samus uses a Power Bomb against it, it will crumble and reveal a Power Bomb Expansion, and a Chozo Lore entry.
The Power Bomb Expansion and Lore entry.
Hacking of the game has revealed an unused version of the Magma Pool, which, rather than magma, was to contain water polluted by Flaahgra's toxins. This poisonous water would have been populated by a swarm of Chomper Fish. The reason for the change to magma is unknown. In the final game, Chomper Fish do not appear active, but are seen frozen in the ice of Phendrana Drifts.
