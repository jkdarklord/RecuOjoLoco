Several years ago, many of us looked through the Metroid II enemy artwork to look for the name of one enemy.
That name... was never found.
When the ULF system came around, it became known as ULF 2, and was the only Metroid II enemy in that list. Eventually, ULF 1 found a name. But never ULF 2. Its name has never been found ever. It eventually became the icon of ULFs everywhere.

In honor of its lack of a name, and of its bizarre behavior, I give it the name, Bob.
