The Materials Storehouse is a room in the warehouse area of the Cryosphere of the BOTTLE SHIP in Metroid: Other M. Materials are transferred to and from this Storehouse via the nearby Materials Transfer Lift.
Samus Aran encounters MB in this room, who is running from Samus and refuses to believe that she is trying to rescue her. MB states that she cannot trust Samus when "[Samus'] troops are willing to kill each other", showing a flashback where Maurice Favreau is frozen and killed by another soldier. MB continues to run, but Samus pursues, until they meet a man in a Galactic Federation Power Suit, utilizing the RB176 Ferrocrusher in the room. Samus destroys the machine, but the discovers that both the operator and the young woman have escaped. Samus is then ordered to return to the Pyrosphere by Adam and descends an elevator shaft to another area of the Cryosphere. As the elevator goes down, Samus remarks that the BOTTLE SHIP happens to be a "nightmare replica of Zebes" and theorizes that there is a traitor of the platoon, nicknaming him the "Deleter" until his identity is found. At the same time, a scene shows the Deleter who had frozen and murdered another soldier in the Pyrosphere and then kicks the dead body into the lava.
Samus defeats the Ferrocrusher.
An Energy Part is located on top of a crate, and a Missile Tank is hidden in a Morph Ball tunnel.
