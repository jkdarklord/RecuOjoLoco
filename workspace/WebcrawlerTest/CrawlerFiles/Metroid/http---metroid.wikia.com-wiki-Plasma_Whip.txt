Samus uses her Plasma Whip on Pit.
The Plasma Whip is an attack performed by Zero Suit Samus in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It is her side special move, and is an electric whip fired from her Paralyzer with small knockback and damage. The move is a little laggish after extending, but comes out at almost the speed of a Smash Attack. In the air it can also be used as a Tether Recovery, like the Plasma Wire, her up special, which also fires the Plasma Whip. However, both attacks differ from each other in that the Plasma Whip has longer horizontal range, but much less vertical range, giving Zero Suit Samus several options for Tether recovering, depending on whether she is level with or below the ledge. The Plasma Wire can also grapple ledges that are below Zero Suit Samus's level, which can be useful for varying up her recovery. This is similar to the Grapple Beam she would use with her Power Suit.
The Plasma Whip does not appear in any Metroid games, and was created for Brawl. However, it may have been based on the energy whip attack used by the Reptilicus.
In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, the Plasma Whip returns as Zero Suit Samus' side B move. However, the Plasma Wire up move has been replaced by Boost Kick. The Plasma Whip has two variants:
The Plasma Whip is part of two of Zero Suit Samus' taunts. In one, she swings the whip in front of her and says "Try me". In the other, she spins with the whip around her and says "You're mine..."

"This move swings a whiplike stream of plasma directly in front of Zero Suit Samus. Opponents struck by the very tip of it will be blasted away."
