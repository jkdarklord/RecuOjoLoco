Hi! I caw the community corner, and I volunteer to revamp the main page. You can see some of my work here, and some of the things I can do here and here. Opinions? If so, I'll get to it ASAP. Thanks! --Bullet Francisco 01:04, November 19, 2011 (UTC)
I received a suggestion that the featured article for december 2011 be Phendrana Drifts. Any objections lady? Other suggestions? The MarioGalaxy2433g5 {talk/contribs} 16:19, November 19, 2011 (UTC)
I figured out why the main page sucks. It USED to look OK before Oasis. The reason is that it uses tables that are described in monobook.css and monaco.css. I'd need to create a new Style Sheet page. The MarioGalaxy2433g5 {talk/contribs} 23:08, November 22, 2011 (UTC)
See, this is why the new skin is terrible [and why I'm using Monobook, as I said earlier]. --RoyboyX (Complaints Box • Resume) 23:20, November 22, 2011 (UTC)
I have no ideaa of what to put for the featured article of January. Any ideas? The MarioGalaxy2433g5 {talk/contribs} 15:47, December 18, 2011 (UTC)
This isn't a complaint or anything, but the Featured Article thingie is broken, in case nobody noticed :S TidusTehSacrificer357 23:19, May 14, 2012 (UTC)
A biography/history article? ChozoBoy (Talk/Contribs) 23:45, May 14, 2012 (UTC)
Metroid: Volume 1? ChozoBoy (Talk/Contribs) 02:20, May 16, 2012 (UTC)

I wonder for many reasons... why on the Recent Activity page does it say "Welcome to my home!" I'm confused as to why whoever wrote that did so...

November 18, 2012 is the 10 year anniversary for Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion. I think it should be mentioned in the News Feed. Kakudomaru (talk) 17:37, November 6, 2012 (UTC)
Somebody is vandalising it, they placed "Penis" inside the news section and had added a picture of a penis in an article on megaroid (I fixed it, but it may have been re-put back in by the time you read this): http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Megaroid, the user is RoyboyX. Can someone stop this person?

I feel like an idiot asking this, but is the background supposed to be Phazon?
Sylux X 22:27, January 9, 2013 (UTC)
So, uh, did we just put aside the whole aesthetical update idea? The Phazon is getting... rather bland. Opinions?

Can the featured article be changed? Mr. Anon (talk) 04:53, April 15, 2013 (UTC)
Seems to be missing. Mr. Anon (talk) 01:56, June 4, 2013 (UTC)
Anyone want to help me clean up some of the trivia sections of this wiki? There's a large number of them that have opinions and guesswork rather than actual trivia. The most common thing is "Creature A looks like creature B". There are some creatures that have a really strong resemblance that should be mentioned but a large number of them are just vaguely the same body shape and some of them are mentioning enemies from completely unrelated games. --M0xxy (talk) 14:41, October 8, 2013 (UTC)
can there be featured polls like

As much as we all enjoy Bob, might you guys agree that we would probably be better off replacing him with some more enticing artwork? ChozoBoy (Talk/Contribs) 22:26, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Hey, if you have any suggestions... --Dr. Anonymous1 (talk) 22:30, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
I do. I'm replacing it now. RoyboyX(complaints/records) 22:43, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Well, personally I think we should vote on this... --Dr. Anonymous1 (talk) 22:51, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Me likes. Has Samus with new jet boots. Jet boots... Yeah, this is good. (Power Suit Samus has foot sticking downward into IRC section title, though). --Fluffy Exterminator {ADMIN} (talk • email • contribs) 23:16, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
That was along the lines of my expectation, Dr. A... Roy, the idea was to see what all of the users thought, not just you in particular or whoever happened to respond in the first twenty minutes. ChozoBoy (Talk/Contribs) 23:20, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Do you like it, however? RoyboyX(complaints/records) 23:27, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Well, yes, though I would rather that the images not both be from SSB4 (for example, maybe the Power Suit pic could be from Metroid Prime 3 or Zero Mission). Also, I think that, in the future, whenever a user proposes such a change, they should be required by protocol to include an example of what they're talking about. --Dr. Anonymous1 (talk) 23:32, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
I try to do so whenever possible. RoyboyX(complaints/records) 23:34, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Well, it'd probably best to do so in this case before making any changes. But anyway, I just think that one of the images be from one of the actual canon games... We could have the first one be of Samus' suit in Prime 2-3, for example. --Dr. Anonymous1 (talk) 23:37, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
The idea was that it'd be from the most recent depiction. Were I to do this in 2011, for example, it would be the MOM art. RoyboyX(complaints/records) 23:39, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
Eh, I dunno... For one thing, SSB's not really a Metroid game. Besides, the front page should showcase some of what the actual Metroid games have to offer. Besides, the current depiction isn't always the best, as we all know. Either way, it isn't up to either of us what gets put up there - we should let others put in their opinion before making a final decision. --Dr. Anonymous1 (talk) 23:43, May 4, 2014 (UTC)
I love the Metroid series!--VideoGameBlogger (talk) 13:34, July 22, 2014 (UTC)
