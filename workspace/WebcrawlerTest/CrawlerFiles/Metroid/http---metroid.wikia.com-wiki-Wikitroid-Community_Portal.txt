Wikitroid, being a wiki, allows you to edit almost every page on this site! You can contribute to articles already made, or create your own!
Articles include beams, various characters, games in the Metroid series, and much more. Why not expand these articles and make them even better than they already are?
You can also help out cleaning up the wiki. Some articles require a cleanup, while others are just too small.
So as you can see, there's a lot to do on this wiki! But most of all, have fun!
You do not have to log in to read Wikitroid. You don't have to log in even to edit articles. Nevertheless, creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, and it's generally considered a good idea to do so for a variety of reasons.
