What I consider myself to be.




Hey everyone, I'm N1ghtrav3n (It would've just been Rav3n, but someone already took that nick).
I'm not very good at talking about myself, but I'll give it a shot anyway. I'm a 24yo Brit who has just finished uni and is currently working as a Community Manager for Guncraft, a voxel game based loosely on Minecraft and Battlefront. I like to think that I know a little bit about the Metroid series, but my main knowledge comes from the Prime series, which I absolutely love. The B'crats seem to agree with this after awarding me with the Patroller right. ^^ EDIT 09/10/14: As of today, I have been promoted to sysop thanks to a successful RfA.
One of my hobbies outside of this, I am also a moderator for a website that specialises in taking chiptunes from programs known as keygens. Before I go further with this, I just want to say one thing: I will NOT provide you with these programs, so don't ask. What I can do instead is link to videos with the music in it (or a link to the music itself), so that is ok (if the admins here allow me to - if not, that's fine too).
Here is a sample of what I do:
KeygenMusic kZ - Moleskinsoft Clone Remover 3.4 Pro crk

I can't think of much more to say, so I guess its your turn to ask questions in my talk page and generally mess around (within reason and the wiki rules ofc).
