The subject of this article is not named in-game. The current title is from a guide or the game's internal data.
One such specimen in Gravity Chamber.
Chomper Fish are fish seen in Metroid Prime that appear to be preserved by being frozen in ice in the Phendrana Drifts. The aquatic organism possesses a large lower jaw containing equally large teeth. They cannot be scanned.
The ice it is seen in cannot be melted or destroyed with the Plasma Beam, leaving it frozen in place for an unknown number of years. Other members of the species could have gone extinct or left the area, as there do not seem to be any active individuals, or at least, none are encountered by Samus Aran during the events of Metroid Prime. Most known members of the species can be found in a few rooms in the deep ice caves surrounding the Gravity Suit, such as the Gravity Chamber and Chamber Access. Some considerably large specimens can be found in the Phendrana Canyon within the ice half-pipe. A dead fish can also be seen resting on a table (if not destroyed) at Research Lab Hydra, likely placed there by a Space Pirate.[1]
These fish slightly resemble the Skultera life-form in 2-D Metroid games. A different kind of fish appears in other areas of Tallon IV, but are active, though not dangerous to Samus.
Their name originates from animation files in the game's data, referenced by the Magma Pool room in the Chozo Ruins. Though they do not exist there in the game, the room's data shows that several of these creatures were to appear swimming in toxic water, which would have replaced the magma seen in the game. This indicates that the Chomper Fish were meant to be one of the few, if not the only, aquatic lifeforms capable of thriving in the hazardous liquid created by the Phazon-exposed Flaahgra. This may also imply that Chomper Fish are the result of Phazon mutation, rather than a natural species of Tallon IV.
