Super Smash Bros., known as Dairantō Smash Brothers (大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ?, lit. "Great Melee Smash Brothers") in Japan, is a second party series of fighting games created by HAL Laboratories pitting various Nintendo characters from their games against each other, including Mario, Link, Kirby, and Samus Aran. So far all games feature Samus as a character, and all four games feature stages based on environments in the Metroid series. The third game, Super Smash Bros. Brawl added for the first time the ability for Samus to be played in her suitless form, known as Zero Suit Samus. The fourth installment in the series is playable in two versions on both the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, the former being the first handheld game in the series. In this installment, Samus was split into 2 different character slots as (Power Suit) Samus and Zero Suit Samus, with Zero Suit Samus getting a new Final Smash as a result.
