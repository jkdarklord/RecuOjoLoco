The Experiment Floor is a room in the Cryosphere in Metroid: Other M. It is a snowy location set on a cliff. Samus battles a Groganch here and discovers the dead body of Maurice Favreau, left there by the Deleter. A survivor is seen watching Samus from a window, and runs away after Samus sees her.
An Accel Charge can be found here under a rock that can be destroyed with a Missile.
