â€”Pit
The Jet Boots are a technology used by Zero Suit Samus in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Like the Plasma Whip, they are an invention of the Super Smash Bros. series and have not appeared in a Metroid game. The Boots come with matching bracelets, which augment her punches, and are used in her new recovery move, Boost Kick. Masahiro Sakurai, in the April 2014 Nintendo Direct explained that these boots were created out of a viewed necessity to "toughen her up", as Zero Suit Samus was not very strong in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (despite being a fairly high tier character in many fan tournament boards). The Jet Boots are worn over the boots on the otherwise identical Zero Suit from Metroid: Other M, which controversially featured Samus in larger, clunky heels. The heels of the Jet Boots have also generated some criticism.
