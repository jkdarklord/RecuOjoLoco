http---metroid.wikia.com-wiki-List_of_Metroid_Prime_version_differences.txt
This page lists some of the differences between the PAL and NTSC versions of Metroid Prime, as well as some of the changes made to the New Play Control! and Metroid Prime Trilogy versions of Prime. The Metroid Prime Trilogy release uses the PAL version for most of the changes, (effectively retconning the NTSC changes) and contains additional differences.
