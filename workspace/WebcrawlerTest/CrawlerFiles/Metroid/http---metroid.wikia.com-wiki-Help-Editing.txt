This page gives information on how to edit with the Source Code editor. This page doesn't cover information on the visual editor.
Wikis allow anybody to edit. However, some people may be new to wikis and thus may not know how to edit. This page is for those people. To edit, you don't need to know HTML to edit an article, all you need to know is English and simple wiki code. You don't even have to register to edit!
The edit button.
To edit a page, simply click the edit button, which is usually found at the top of the page. Clicking on this button will open the edit box. Once here, simply type in what you want! It's that easy!
The bottom part of the edit window.
When you're done typing, click on the save page button at the bottom of the page. However, before doing so, you may want to click on the show preview button to proofread what you typed. You can also include a summary of what you typed to help other editors get an idea of what you did to the article.
Above the edit box are several buttons:
To add images, you must first upload it. Once you've done this, you can edit a page and add [[File:NAMEOFIMAGE.FILETYPE]] to the page.
Categories help organize pages. To add a category, simply type something like this at the bottom of the article: [[Category:Games]] If you want to add more than one category, simply list them all, like this: [[Category:Games]] [[Category:Characters]]
Redirecting a page.
Redirecting pages is useful for sending misspelled pages to the correctly spelled pages. To do this, simply create a page and then type #Redirect [[page name]]. For example, typing #REDIRECT [[Samus Aran]] on Samus will make that page automatically link to Samus Aran.
Redirects can be used for a number of things:
However, redirects should not be used to redirect one namespace to another; instead, these pages should be moved. For an unclear term with more than one possible meaning, a disambiguation page may be an alternative to a redirect. Don't forget to redirect any mis-spellings of this term to the disambiguation page.
The move button.
Moving a page will rename it. To do this, click the move button at the top of the page. You must be logged in to move a page. A redirect page will be created automatically, so moving a page does not break links. The page's history and talk will be moved along with it.
The history button.
If you see a page messed up, you can simply revert it to a correct previous version. To do this, you:
If you want to try something out just to see how it looks, you can use the sandbox. The sandbox is just for experimenting, so any changes made to it are temporary.
The VisualEditor
The classic editor
Editing on Wikia is generally as simple as clicking the 'Edit' button on a page. Doing so will take you to an edit page where you can make changes to the page - such adding new information and media, correcting errors, or updating the formatting.
Depending on whether you are logged in, you may receive a different editing experience:
Once in an editor, you can use the available tools to quickly add and remove information, change the formatting, add new images and videos, update the page's layout and much more! Once you're done making your changes, just click the 'Publish' button to update the page.
Don't be afraid if you 'break' anything. All edits to a page are stored in the page history, and if something does go wrong you can simply revert to an older version.
Logged in users can choose their default editor from a dropdown list in their user preferences (found here).
Accessing the classic editor, when the VisualEditor is default
Anonymous users will generally always see the VisualEditor by default. In a few specific cases, the VisualEditor may not be available on a particular wikia.
Additionally, the alternative editors can still be found under the 'Edit' button dropdown - for example, you can still access the classic editor from the dropdown even if the VisualEditor is the default.
