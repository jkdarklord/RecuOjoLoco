The Master Artisan is a Chozo individual identified in unused Chozo Lore from Metroid Prime. The Artisan is described as the creator of the twelve Chozo Artifacts used to seal the Impact Crater. As this entry was not used, it is unknown how the Artifacts were officially created. Of note is that the Lore entry, "Artifacts", is only found within the data of Metroid Prime Trilogy, but not the original game. This may suggest it was intended as a new addition. The entry is missing its English localization, but is present in French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese. The translation below is based on the versions of the Lore in those languages.
