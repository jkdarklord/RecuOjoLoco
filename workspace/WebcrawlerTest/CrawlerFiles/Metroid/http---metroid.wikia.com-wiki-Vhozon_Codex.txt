The Vhozon Codex is a book used by the Vhozon race in training disciples for combat. Codex training has at least five levels, and those who reach the fifth level are awarded the Judicator, a powerful weapon that can fire streams of supercooled plasma. Given the Vhozon's strict moral code and ruthlessness, it would not be a stretch to say that Vhozon Codex training is likely difficult and taxing. The Vhozon Bounty Hunter Noxus reached the fifth level, as he possesses the Judicator during Metroid Prime Hunters.
"The Judicator is a powerful weapon given to acolytes who reach the fifth level of Vhozon Codex training. It can literally shatter the unworthy by blasting them with streams of energy that have been supercooled to nearly absolute zero."
