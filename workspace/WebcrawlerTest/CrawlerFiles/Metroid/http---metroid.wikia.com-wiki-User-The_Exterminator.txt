Hello all! I'm Madax the Shadow (formerly The Exterminator). I'm an admin here, so ask me anything you need. Other than that, I'm just another guy that enjoys Metroid, Legend of Zelda, and other stuff. I'd probably nerd-out if you gave me the chance.
I would like to thank those that supported me in becoming an administrator and bureaucrat.
Check out these pages, too.
I'm really not an active editor at the moment, but I usually check the logs at least once a day. So I am still here even if it doesn't seem like it! Mostly I'm just reviewing/patrolling the edits and making sure there's not a meltdown anywhere. Even if I don't look like I'm active, you are more than welcome to send a message to me and probably get a response within a day or two. Eventually I will get better at hanging out on IRC, but my current work schedules really don't give me time.
No current projects.
I've played every Metroid game (not counting spinoffs aka Prime Pinball) except for fully completing the original Metroid and Metroid II.
Yup, I got Smash 4. Wanna add me for that or any game? Here you go.
Hey! Be sure to sign below if you've trekked through here. I like seeing all the people that come through, and seeing your names here will most likely give a bad case of nostalgia to me. Anyways, I'll see ya 'round! Madax the Shadow {ADMIN} (talk • logs • contribs)

I should've signed your book a long time ago. Ah well. See ya round! --RoyboyX 20:28, January 17, 2010 (UTC)
Nice Story! My favorite game is Prime 1, and I agree with you about the little (no) human confrontation, but it makes sense, as no humans went to Tallon IV. --Captain Silver
Hi, thats a cool story you have there. Metroid Master 17:15, June 24, 2010 (UTC) P.S. Zoomers are amazing.
That story was really cool. And I agree, I didn't like Metroid all that much mainly because it was quite hard. But I cant wait for Other M, and others to come. Congratulations on becoming an admin! Glitch388 04:02, January 20, 2010 (UTC)
Hey thanks for all the links you sent on my talk page it really helped. :) The original Metroid was just horrible and the Light suit is the greatest suit in all the land. (W13opa fan 04:54, July 19, 2010 (UTC))
Lorgassssssss- =) 22:53, August 20, 2010 (UTC)
I really liked the story you wrote! You should write some more, with zoomers in them (because zoomers are awesome). Wonderwalrus 02:08, August 26, 2010 (UTC) P.S. walruses are amazing
Best user ever :) DoctorPain99 04:04, June 20, 2011 (UTC)
The story was good. I also love polls, so you're doing it RIGHT. TidusTehSacrificer357 01:02, April 15, 2012 (UTC)
I have nothing to do with my life. User:Sylux X 02:27, June 18, 2012 (UTC)
The amount of polls is so many, it would take me quite a while for me to answer them all. Mogenar (chat log) 20:59, September 7, 2013 (UTC)
