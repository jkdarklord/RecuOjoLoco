I am currently engaged in writing a book. I would strongly encourage you to pop over to [1] and read over what I have so far of They Chose To Remain (The AVATAR fanfic for people who didn't like AVATAR), especially if you have drawing skills (as I rather desperately need an illustrator). Eventually new chapters will be posted there- when that happens, they will be linked here.
My current project involves examining and cleaning up pages containing little to no relevant information, especially those describing subjects that already exist in the real world. A lot of these pages are clearly unprofessional or strange, but others are hazier. Hence, one at a time I intend to bring each page listed here under examination for its merits, and either delete it or reassign it permanently to a "relevent" category.
Note that I do not think all of these pages deserve to be deleted- they are simply the ones that I think could use a second look.
If you have any pages you think should be considered, please fee free to suggest them on my talk page.
Currently no official policy of this sort exists, forcing me to rely on individual debates for each page: I await the outcome of any RfC on the subject.
Alright, this one is fairly simple. These "Behind the scenes" sections in articles were originally started by PirateHunter, but I've decided I want to expand them. From now on, any piece of technology in game with anything of substance to say about how it works that isn't immediately obvious will get an explanation, courtesy of Wikitroid's resident technological expert. -- "My name is AdmiralSakai, and I approve this message." 01:16, April 3, 2012 (UTC)
