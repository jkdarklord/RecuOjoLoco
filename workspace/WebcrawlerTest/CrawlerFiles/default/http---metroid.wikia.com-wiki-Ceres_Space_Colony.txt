Ceres Space Colony, the start of Super Metroid.
Ceres Space Colony (スペースコロニー Supēsu Koronī) was where Super Metroid began. After taking the baby aboard her gunship, Samus Aran brought it to the Space Science Academy on Ceres for research. Shortly after she left, Ceres' distress signal activated and she returned to the colony to find it dark and all of the colony members dead. She progressed through the colony and met Ridley, holding the Baby in his talons. Samus and Ridley battled, but the Pirate fled and activated a Countdown. Samus escaped and Ceres exploded shortly afterwards. She then followed Ridley to Zebes, which she tore apart in search of the Baby.
