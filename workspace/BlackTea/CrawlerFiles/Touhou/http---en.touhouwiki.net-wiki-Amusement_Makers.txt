Amusement Makers is an unofficial student group of the Tokyo Denki University Department of Science and Engineering. As such, Amusement Makers' membership changes over time, as does the nature of the projects it runs. Many members use the Amusement Makers name for their own works developed during the period of their association with the student group, so the Amusement Makers name graces works such as the PC-98 Touhou games (Touhou 1 to 5, which were developed by ZUN in his school days) and Shuusou Gyoku (which was developed by members of "Shunsatsu sare do?").
Other relevant (past) members of Amusement Makers include RebRank (the developers of Project Blank) and "Shunsatsu sare do?" (developers of the Seihou Project, also two members participated in Project Blank).
